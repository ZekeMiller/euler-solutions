divisibility by 3 knocks out lots of contenders
    1 + 2 = 3
    1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45

n belongs to [1,4,7,8]

the example of 2143 removes 1

n is in [4,7,8]

that's enough to make this millisecond time scale speed
