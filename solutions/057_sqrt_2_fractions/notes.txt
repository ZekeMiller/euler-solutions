the equation is of the form 1 + 1 / ( 2 + 1 / ( 2 + ... ) )

Let Ti (term i) = Ni/Di = the i-th iteration of the equation above

let ti be the portion of the equation that would allow the entire equation to be reprsented as 1 + 1/ti (for the i-th iteration)

ti = ni/di
ni = 2*n(i-1)+d(i-1)
di = n(i-1)

we can use this to quickly and easily generate all of the fractions from the previous ones
