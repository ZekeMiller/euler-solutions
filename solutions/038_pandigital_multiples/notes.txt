n must be greater than 1, so the minimum n value is 2.  Let i be the integer that is multiplied and concatenated (192 in the example given).


We know the maximum is over 918273645, so since the first concatenated part must start with 9 and be the result of i * 1, i must start with a 9.  This means that i >= 90.

We also know i cannot be a multiple of 5, since i must be multiplied ( at minimum ) by 1 and 2, which will always result in at least one 0, which is invalid.  From this we know that i >= 91 and i % 5 != 0.

We also know that the length of i must be < 5, since 5 + 5 > 9.  We can also make a few assumptions based on the length of i ( we already know i must be length 2, 3, or 4 ).
    If i is length 2, the concatenation must be of 2+2+2+3, so len(i) == 2 -> n == 4
        This means i*1, i*2, and i*3 must all have length 2 (i <= 33 ), and i*4 must have length 3 ( i >= 25 )
            Based on this constraint len(i) == 2 -> ( 25 <= i <= 33 ) and n == 4
            However, since we know i must start with a 9, len(i) must not equal 2

    If i is length 3, the concatenation must be of 3+3+3, so len(i) == 2 -> n == 4
        This means i*1, i*2, and i*3 must all have length 3, so len(i) == 3 -> ( 100 <= i <= 333 )
        However, since we know i must start with a 9, len(i) must not equal 3

    If i is length 4, the concatenation must be 4 + 5, so len(i) == 4 => n = 2
        This means len(i*1) == 4 and len(i*2) == 5, so 5000 <= i <= 9999
        However, the restriction of i starting with 9 reduces this to i >= 9001 and i % 5 != 0

    From this, we can restrict the possible values of i to about 500 possibilities, with the following restrictions:
        1) i >= 9001
        2) i <= 9999
        3) i % 5 != 0
        4) n = 2

    Mathematically reducing it any further starts having diminishing returns when I can just write a quick script to find the correct value.



I had the idea to try to fully prove that 9327,2 = 932718654 is maximal mathematically, given only the fact that 9,4 = 918273645 is not maximal.

Given everything from above, we know that the first digit is a 9, and there are 3 more digits, and that n=2.

We can infer that the second digit is less than 5, since if it is greater than 5, a 1 will carry over from multiplying by 2, and the i*2 term will begin with 19, meaning 9 will appear twice, making the result non-pandigital.

Currently we have: 9[2,3,4][][]18[][][2,4,6]

the possibilities for the first term are:
    9
    2,3,4
    2,3,4,5,6,7
    2,3,4,5,6,7

Since the 9 multiplies to the 18, the last three digits in each of i and i*2, (e and e2) must satisfy 2 * e = e2
4 cannot be in i, as it will force a 8 or 9
5 cannot be in i, as it will force a 0 or 1

Thus,

    9
    [2,3]                   ( >= 5 forces a 9 )
    [2,3,6,7]
    [2,3,6,7]

    1
    8
    [4,5,6,7]
    [2,3,4,5,6,7]   ( 2 or 3 from 6, 6 or 7 from 3, 4 or 5 from 2 or 7 )
    [ (1)2{6}, 4{2}, (1)4{7}, 6{3} ]


3 in first position ( if successful it must be correct, as 3 > 2 )

    9
    3
    [2,7]       6 cannot yield 5
    [2,6,7]
    1
    8
    [6,7]
    5           only place a 5 is valid
    [ 2{6}, 4{7} ]


    9
    3
    2           7 here forces the carry from the 5 to make another 7
    7
    1
    8
    6
    5
    4

The rest follows from simple elimination and logic
