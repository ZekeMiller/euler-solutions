# euler-solutions
My personal solutions to Project Euler prompts.

## Do NOT read if you intend to solve the prompts yourself.

Some of the questions can be done with some clever math, and thus may not have a solution written, or may have trivial programs written to reflect the math I did by hand.

The code included is largely undocumented, as I will not be reusing it and it is purely to solve these problems.

I have been writing mostly in Python, as the speed of the solution for a project euler question tends to depend on the algorithm the solver comes up with, and typically a scripting language ( or at least applying python as a scripting language ) is an appropriate solution.  Where I feel it is benificial ( such as my modified Dijkstra's algorithm for max path sum in problems 18 and 67 ), I am not opposed to using other languages ( Java in that case ), and as I continue to learn new languages, I will incorporate them into solutions here.
